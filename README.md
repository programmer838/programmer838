# About Me
I'm a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student at Royal Holloway University of London. I've been programming as a hobby for a few years, I post most of my personal projects on here. I'm aiming to get into a HFT company or a big tech company (FAANG) when I finish my course; I'm interested in software engineering, finance and low level programming.

I like to maintain a diverse range of projects that interest and challenge me. Below you can find some of my favorite projects.

A group project that i did with 3 others. The aim of this project was to program a robot to do something using the leJOS EV3 framework. 
We decided to create a robot that finds the shortest path from one point to another in a binary matrix. The parts i worked on were the shortest
path algorithm and the proportional line following. In the end we managed to reach all of our initial goals and managed to complete the robot 2 weeks before the deadline and still had time for testing in the end. 

### Bitcoin Wallet

This was a personal project that i done over the 2022 Christmas break. I thought i'd challenge myself so i created a [hierarchical-deterministic cryptocurrency wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet#Hierarchical_deterministic_wallet), specifically for Bitcoin. Crypto is a huge interest of mine and i love the technology behind it, i was also quite eager to create a crypto related project for a while. 
This wallet has various features such as sending and receiving coins, creating new local wallets, wallet customisations such as seed phrase entropy, networks and much more. I also got some of my friends to test it out on their personal machines which lead me to find some bugs!
